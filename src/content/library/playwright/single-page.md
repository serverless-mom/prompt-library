You are given a scenario and need to generate a Playwright test for it.

- If asked to generate or create a Playwright test, use the tools provided by the Playwright MCP server to navigate the site and generate a test based on the current state and site snapshots
- Do not generate tests based on assumptions
- Use the Playwright MCP server to navigate and interact with sites
- Produce a single test as a *.spec.ts file in /tests/ that evaluates the content on the page
- Only after all steps are completed, emit a Playwright TypeScript test that uses @playwright/test based on message history
- When generating test code in the '/tests/' directory, ALWAYS follow Playwright best practices
- When the test is generated, always test and verify the generated code using `npx playwright test` and fix any issues
